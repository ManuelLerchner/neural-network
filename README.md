# Neural-Network
A simple neural network written in rust.


## About
This implementation of a neural network using gradient-descent is completely written from ground up using rust.
It is possible to specify the shape of the network, as well as  the learning-rate of the network. Additionally, you can choose from one of many predefined datasets, for example the XOR- and CIRCLE Datasets, which represent the relative functions inside the union-square. As well as more complicated datasets like the RGB_DONUT, which represents a donut-like shape with a rainbow like color transition.

Below, you can see a training process, where the network is trying to learn the color-values of the RGB_DONUT dataset.
